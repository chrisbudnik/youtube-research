This effectively puts the 12-month inflation rate at just 2.5%, with Energy being one of the main culprits, having fallen 4%. On top of that, Used Cars and Trucks have declined 10%, new vehicles are down 1.2%, and oil is down 12.1% over a year.\\n\\nTHE STOCK MARKET: \\nSince the market is always forward-looking, stocks might sell off because rate hikes have already been priced in. For instance, one Investing.com analysis made the argument that investors “front-run” and anticipate future rate hikes - or cuts - and therefore, everything that happened today is already factored into where it’s trading. In terms of what’s most likely to happen in the future, history tells us that it all depends on whether or not we avoid a recession, which means according to all of the data, it appears as though rate cuts do not make AS BIG of a difference as people make it out to be, compared to the overall health of the economy.\\n\\nHOUSING PRICES: \\nThe good news - for buyers - is that prices are starting to get cut. A recent report found that “The share of available listings that saw a price cut in July rose to 18.9%, causing the median price to fall from $445,000 to $439,000.\"  Realtor dot com says there are two reasons for this: First, interest rates remain higher than expected (which means less buyer activity) and, two, a lot of would-be buyers are holding out for lower mortgage rates in the future - so, sellers are reducing their prices to entice them back. \\n\\nIn terms of rental prices, new data found that one-in-three property managers offered a concession on rents amid a glut of supply.
